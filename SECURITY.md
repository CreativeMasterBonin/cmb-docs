# Security Policy
We want the docs page to be secure. If any links are invalid or cause browsers to report a fraudulent website, please report the link. We will clean up the website as fast as we possibly can.

## Reporting a Vulnerability


Open an issue using the 'issues' tab. DO NOT GIVE US ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.
Security issues need to be tagged as 'security'. Choose the SECURITY issue template to apply this tag.

Describe the issue clearly, and tell us which page it occurs on.

When a vulnerable part of the website is identified as dangerous and confirmed, we will fix it as fast as possible. This is only done if users report the issue in the first place.
