<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>There aren't any right now... but here are questions that you might've wanted answered.</p><br>

<faq>Q1) What does CMB use to mod with?</faq><br>
<faqans>A1) Simple, an IDE.</faqans><br><br>

<faq>Q2) What is frequently updated?</faq><br>
<faqans>A2) Not everything is all at once updated, so mostly Thingamajigs and it's addons are priority.</faqans><br><br>

<faq>Q3) What is this website?</faq><br>
<faqans>A3) It is more of a documentation hosted with GitHub Pages, so it's like a website, but smaller, it contains basic info and some more detailed things here and there, and maybe some fun too.</faqans><br><br>

<p>In order to install classic Thingamajigs, you'll need Forge, specifically the one for each version cycle of the mod. The most up to date and popular for it's cycle is MC 1.20.1.
<br><br><br>
    If installing Thingamajigs 2, Overpowered Mastery or CMATD, you'll need NeoForge. Usually this one updates to each major MC version (well almost). 1.21.1 is the most popular and well documented version. Hopefully newest and 1.21.1 versions will always be synced in terms of features. If not, be very patient, it may take months or longer to update (4+ different mod codebases to manage!).<br><br>
     Thingamajigs Long Roads or Thingamajigs Railroadways requires NeoForge and Thingamajigs 2, as it needs it as a base or 'core' mod to work. These mods always try to update just after the main mod updates, as they are basically feature complete.
