<h2>1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>For MC 1.21.8! Tested with NeoForge 21.8.36. Seems to work on dedicated servers.
    We completely overhauled this mod. If updating from a previous version, you will lose all progress and items.</p>
<h4>Additions and Improvements:</h4>
<ul class="mod-features">
    <li>Wub Weapons (they use the power of music to do all kinds of fine things, 6 types)</li>
    <li>Long Spears (charge with right click, and can be augmented with enchants, experiement with them to figure out your strategy)</li>
    <li>Bone Sword (a classic sword, but made out of bones)</li>
    <li>Tool Bindings (used for crafting certain special use tools and weapons, like the Long Spears)</li>
    <li>Penultimate Sword (two phases, uncraftable right now)</li>
    <li>Endarkened Crossbow (can shoot snowballs, fire charges, shulker bullets, and more)</li>
    <li>Moving Probable Block (it's back and better than ever; randomly generates a 'reward', but be warned, can be tricky)</li>
    <li>Instarepair Enchantment (no xp required, just wait and watch the tools repair themselves; very rare to obtain)</li>
    <li>The ability to toggle a certain players' mouse ears for clientside only</li>
</ul>
    <p>This mod uses mixins. Please report any incompatibilities with other mod mixins.

    Confirmed to work with some other mob and enchantment mods.</p>

<h2>1.0.2 Release</h2>
<h4>Additions and Improvements:</h4>
<ul class="mod-features">
    <li>Added Inert Essence Ore Blocks and their associated Essences (these are not obtainable yet, but recipes are there for when you can find them in the world)</li>
    <li>Strange Stone (mine stone and dirt, and you may get some of them, configurable drop chance, used to make the Redstone Base Component)</li>
    <li>Redstone Base Component (useless right now, but can be crafted)</li>
    <li>Auroran Processor (an ancient processor that will create powerful weapons)</li>
    <li>Essence Electronic Core (essences and the auroran processor combined)</li>
    <li>Ultimate Ingot (will be used to craft ultimate weapons in the future)</li>
    <li>Ultra Ingot (will be used to craft ultra weapons in the future)</li>
    <li>Ultimate Staff (the almost-perfect power staff, hold right click to continously shoot fireballs, wither skulls, and more, depending on how long you use the item for, or right click blocks and phase right through them)</li>
    <li>Ultra Sword (the most OP sword in the mod, uncraftable for now, but can knock out any mobs with 100000 health in one hit [note that 1 health is half a heart])</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technical Changes:</h4>
<ul class="mod-features">
    <li> Perchance may have fixed some weirdness with some items to either make them more fun, or less fun because they broke something</li>
    <li>Client Visual-Only Hax like minecart on head and upsidedown and ears should be more server safe, if they weren't before by also being checked with a real server test environment</li>
    <li>Moved around some code to be more expandable in the future</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>1.0.3 Release</h2>
<h4>Additions and Improvements:</h4>
<ul class="mod-features">
    <li>Multi-Assembler (used to craft nearly all items in the mod; things take time to craft, 7 items for all recipes, data-driven)</li>
    <li>Deepslate Inert Essence Ores</li>
    <li>Inert Essence Ores can spawn in the world at the deepest depths and highest of heights, depending on the type of ore as well as positional circumstances</li>
    <li>Ultimate Bow (just spam right click fast and fire potion-powered flaming arrows with near-perfect accuracy!)</li>
    <li>Ultimate Hoe (till a 3x3 area and hydrate the farmland you just made with one shift-right click, otherwise, using the item will bonemeal blocks around the center of your hit zone)</li>
    <li>Ultimate Fishing Rod (instant-fish anything fishing-related; the second the bobber goes 'SPLASH', reel in the line!)</li>
    <li>Some Music Disc Weapons had their recipes changed to better match their theming</li>
    <li>Infused Concentrated Multi Essence (strike Concentrated Multi Essence with the power of lightning to obtain)</li>
    <li>Penultimate Sword Catalyst (created with expensive ingredients, but unlocks the two paths for the Penultimate Sword)</li>
    <li>Ultimate Ingot can be crafted using the Multi-Assembler</li>
    <li>Penultimate Swords can be crafted using the Multi-Assembler</li>
    <li>Ultimate Sword can be crafted using the Multi-Assembler (this thing is expensive, time and resource-wise!)</li>
    <li>Items added to special categories with their own rarities</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technical Changes:</h4>
<ul class="mod-features">
    <li>Refactored some code to add optimization or future special abilities to existing items (vanilla and modded)</li>
    <li>Client Visual-Only Mouse Ears hax had new texture option added (UV mapping or otherwise is broken right now, but doesn't crash). Has a default state (to use your skin, as original code did) if nothing is specified or incorrectly specified</li>
    <li>Some tags were added to blocks and items to make it less likely for them to be buggy with or not work at all with other mods</li>
</ul>
